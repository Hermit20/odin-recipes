    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your oven to 180°C / fan 160°C.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl with the vegetable oil, 
            curry powder, dried thyme, cayenne pepper (if using) and a generous 
            pinch of salt. Toss to coat and leave to marinate for at least an hour 
            or overnight if you can. If short on time, just let it sit while you prep 
            the stew base.
        </li>
        <li>Blitz the red bell pepper, tomatoes, red onion, scotch bonnets, ginger, 
            water and salt in a blender until smooth. Set aside
        </li>

        <li>
           Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
           Working in batches, cook the chicken skin-side down until browned, 
           3 to 5 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3 minutes, 
           or until browned on the other side. Transfer to a plate, 
           leaving the oil in the pan. Note: The chicken won&rsquo;t be cooked 
           through at this stage&hyphen;it&rsquo;ll finish cooking with the rice. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Turn the heat down to medium. Add the onion and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 
            3 to 5 minutes. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the double concentrated tomato purée and cook, 
            stirring frequently, until it darkens, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. 
            Partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has 
            reduced by about a third and the oil begins to separate, 12 to 15 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir in the curry powder, dried thyme, stock pot, bay leaves and water. 
            Season with salt and pepper to taste, then cover and bring to a boil.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear, 
            then drain well. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the rice to the sauce, stir in any resting chicken juices, 
            then arrange the browned chicken thighs over the top. 
            As soon as everything comes to a simmer, cover, 
            transfer to the oven and bake for 45 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove the pot from the oven and leave covered for 
            10 minutes to finish steaming the rice.
        </li>

        <li>
            Optional but worth it: Heat your grill to high. 
            Transfer the chicken to a baking tray, brushing off any rice. 
            Brush lightly with oil and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, 
            or until browned and crisping at the edges.
        </li>

        <li>
            To serve, spoon the rice onto a large platter and top with the chicken. 
            Fried plantain and salad on the side make it a proper feast.
        </li>

        
    </ol>
