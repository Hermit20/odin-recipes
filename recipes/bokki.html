    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Korean Beef and Rice Cakes meal is a dish I make when 
        I want something quick and easy to throw together. 
        I use it when I don&rsquo;t have any meals prepped in the fridge 
        and need to get food on my plate for dinner 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium (60 g) carrot</li>
        <li>5 medium (40 g) green onions</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup (200 g) kimchi</li>
        <li>1 lb (454 g) rice cakes</li>
        <li>1 lb (454 g) 90/10 beef</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) gochujang</li>
        <li>2 tsp (8 g) sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) rice cake water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start a pot of water over the stove and bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Cut your vegetables while the water boils. 
            Use a vegetable peeler to create ribbons with the carrot. 
            Chop the green onions into thin slices separating the whites from the 
            greens. Mince your garlic. Measure out the kimchi and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the water boils, add your rice cakes and cook for the specified time on the package. 
            When they are floating and easily pierced by a fork, remove them from the water. 
            Store the rice cakes in cold water until you are ready for them later. 
            Be sure to reserve some of the starchy water to help create the sauce. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large wok or skillet over medium high heat and drizzle in Â½ tbsp (8g) of oil and add 
            in the beef. Season with salt and brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the beef is about 80% of the way cooked, 
            create some space in the center and allow the fat rendered off the beef 
            to pool. Add the scallions, garlic, and kimchi and cook for a minute or 
            two to become fragrant. Then add in the carrots and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sauce can be constructed right in the wok/skillet. 
            Add the gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, and 2&hyphen;3 tbsp of the starchy water. 
            Dump in the cooked rice cakes. As this heats up it will thicken the sauce. 
            Add more starchy water if you feel it is necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste test and adjust the flavor with salt, pepper, 
            or even sugar if needed. Top with green onions and sesame seeds 
            if you wish.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
